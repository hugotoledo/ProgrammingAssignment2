## cachematrix.R is the program we create for our Programming Assignment 2
## it serves to teach us about using functions as arguments and storing data in another context or frame
## it has two functions, makeCacheMatrix() and cacheSolve()


## makeCacheMatrix holds the previously calculated value, if any, and the functions to check for, save and return it

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
